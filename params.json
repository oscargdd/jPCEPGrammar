","body":"### PCEP Tutorial and Grammar\r\nPCEP stands for Path Computation Element Protocol. Since it initial specification in RFC 5440, a lot of new RFCs and drafts have been published. This web page, powered by a javascript library, aims at compiling the grammar of all PCEP RFCs and drafts. The document [draft-cmfg-pce-pcep-grammar-02](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-cmfg-pce-pcep-grammar-02) expresses the concern with current issues with existing RBNF notation for PCEP messages and extensions.\r\n\r\n### Author\r\nOscar Gonzalez de Dios (@oscargdd)\r\n\r\n### Acknowledgement\r\nThis work was supported in part by the [PACE Support Action project](www.ict-pace.net) under grant agreement number 619712.\r\n\r\nThe idea of having a web page with all the messages and objects from PCEP came from discussions in IETF and in the PACE Project between Adrian Farrel, Ram√≥n Casellas and Oscar Gonzalez. The discussions in IETF regarding existing RBNF notation for PCEP messages and extensions also included Cyril Margaria, Dhruv Dody and Xian Zhang.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
